OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!

## Setup

> You can find some less common installation variations as well as instructions to run Juice Shop on a variety of cloud computing providers in
> [the _Running OWASP Juice Shop_ documentation](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/part1/running.html).

> Some challenges require an AI/LLM provider to work properly. Check the
> [_Setting up external dependencies_ documentation](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/snapshot/part1/running.html#_setting_up_external_dependencies)
> for instructions on configuring local or cloud-based AI providers.

### Assignment secrets management

The application reads secrets from its process environment. No external-service
credentials are required for basic startup. The root `.env.example` contains only
empty placeholders:

- `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`: optional Alchemy access for the Web3 challenges.
- `LLM_API_KEY`: optional authentication for the configured LLM provider; the
  default local Ollama configuration does not require this key.
- `SOLUTIONS_WEBHOOK`: optional challenge-solution notification URL. Leave it
  empty for the assignment demonstration. The application currently logs this
  URL, so do not supply a credential-bearing URL without addressing that logging.
- `CTF_KEY`: optional private override for CTF flag generation. An empty value
  retains the bundled `ctf.key` training fallback.

For local configuration, copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the repository root and
edit only the values needed for your setup. Keep this file private. After installing
dependencies and building the application, start it from the repository root with:

```shell
node --env-file=.env build/app
```

This command explicitly loads the file; `npm start` does **not** automatically
load `.env`. Alternatively, set process environment variables before `npm start`.
Existing process environment values take precedence over Node's environment file.

For Docker Compose, run `docker compose up --build` from the repository root.
Compose reads the root `.env` for interpolation, and the service explicitly passes
the four variables to the container at runtime. Host environment values take
precedence over `.env`. Missing or empty values retain the application's existing
defaults; `.env` is not required for basic Compose startup. Git ignores `.env` and
`.env.*` except `.env.example`. Docker excludes `.env` and `.env.*` at all directory
levels, including `.env.example`, from the build context. These rules do not
protect secrets stored under other filenames.
Secrets must not be placed in Docker build arguments or image layers.

#### GitHub Secrets demonstration

After the separately approved repository configuration step, a collaborator can
create `MEMBER3_DEMO_SECRET` under **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions >
New repository secret**. Use a private, disposable demonstration value with no
external-service access. No Alchemy, LLM, webhook or CTF credential is needed.

Once `secrets-management-demo.yml` exists on the default branch, select **Actions >
Secrets Management Demonstration > Run workflow**. This manual workflow maps the
GitHub encrypted secret into a step-scoped environment variable, fails if it is
empty, and prints only a fixed success message. It performs no checkout and has
no token permissions. It does not change the existing security gates.

This proves GitHub Secret-to-workflow injection and presence, not application
consumption or successful authentication with an external service. Application
runtime provisioning uses the local or Compose paths described above. Existing
CI references to `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` and `E2E_SOLUTIONS_WEBHOOK` do not establish that
those repository secrets have been configured.

#### Handling and evidence

Never commit real credentials or paste them into commands, screenshots, reports
or logs. Avoid environment dumps and expanded Compose configuration output when
secrets are configured. Restrict repository access to trusted collaborators and
replace secrets through their private configuration source when rotating them.
If a real credential is disclosed, revoke or rotate it at its provider first and
coordinate removal from exposed files and history; adding an ignore rule does
not remove an already tracked secret.

Capture the saved GitHub Secret **name only**, the workflow's fixed success
message and commit reference, and runtime verification that reports only
presence/success. In the assignment report (Sections 2.5 and 3.3), explain both
provisioning paths, access and rotation, and the limits of the evidence. Document
Member 3's contribution and AI assistance in the group contribution statement.
The existing Gitleaks exceptions cover inherited training fixtures; they do not
remove those values from history or establish that all assignment requirements
are satisfied. Distinguish these fixtures from operational secrets and clarify
their acceptability with the lecturer.

Juice Shop is automatically tested _only on the latest `.x` minor version_ of each node.js version mentioned above!
There is no guarantee that older minor node.js releases will always work with Juice Shop!
Please make sure you stay up to date with your chosen version.
